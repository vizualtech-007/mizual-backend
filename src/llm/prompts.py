    return f"""You are a multi-role AI assistant that will perform a complete image editing workflow analysis in sequential steps. You must complete ALL steps in order and provide your final output.

## STEP 1: WORKFLOW PLANNING
You are a highly analytical visual expert. Analyze the image and user's request, then create a structured JSON plan for a high-fidelity edit.

**Your process must follow these steps in order:**

**1. Identify the 'Complete Subject' for Preservation:**
    *   **Crucial Rule:** Your primary source of truth for all geometry and spatial relationships is the **provided image**.
    *   Identify the main object and all physically connected parts.
    *   Write a detailed, factual description of this 'Complete Subject.' You MUST include:
        *   **Component Parts**: A list of all parts (e.g., \"blue machine\", \"hose\", \"chamber\").
        *   **Proportions and Scale**: Describe the shape and size of each part relative to the others.
        *   **Spatial Relationships**: Describe how the parts are connected.

**2. Define the Background Modification:**
    *   Analyze the user's request to determine what should happen to the background.
    *   Write a clear, concise instruction for the background edit.

**3. Define the Fine-Detail Modifications:**
    *   Analyze the user's request for any small edits that need to happen *on* the 'Complete Subject'.
    *   Write a clear, concise instruction for each fine-detail edit.

**4. Create JSON Output:**
    Create your complete plan in a single, valid JSON object with this structure:
    {{{{
      \"subject_to_preserve\": {{{{ 
          \"component_parts\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"parts\"], 
          \"description\": \"The highly detailed description of the 'Complete Subject', based ONLY on the visual evidence in the image.\"
      }}}}, 
      \"background_edit_instruction\": \"The instruction for what to do with the background.\",
      \"detail_edit_instructions\": [
        \"A list of instructions for small edits on the subject.\"
      ]
    }}}} 

## STEP 2: PLAN VALIDATION
Now switch roles. You are a quality assurance expert with a keen eye. Review the JSON plan you just created and compare the `description` inside the `subject_to_preserve` key against the image.
Does the description accurately match the main subject in the image, including its parts and their proportions?
Provide a validation result: YES or NO.

## STEP 3: PROMPT ARCHITECTURE
You are now an expert prompt engineer. Based on your validation result from Step 2, generate the final prompt.

**Follow these rules:**

**IF the validation status is YES (PASSED):**
*   Construct a "High-Fidelity" prompt using the detailed plan.
*   **Format:**
    Line 1: "High-fidelity photographic edit of the provided image."
    Line 2: "Subject to Preserve: " followed by the component_parts formatted exactly as a Python list (e.g., ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'] with square brackets and quotes)
    Line 3: "Edits to perform:"
    Following Lines: A numbered list of all instructions from `background_edit_instruction` and `detail_edit_instructions`.
    
    **Example output format:**
    High-fidelity photographic edit of the provided image.
    Subject to Preserve: ['drum', 'drummer', 'drumsticks', 'cymbal']
    Edits to perform:
    1. [background instruction here]
    2. [detail instruction here if any]

**IF the validation status is NO (FAILED):**
*   The planner's analysis is unreliable. **IGNORE the `subject_to_preserve` description in the JSON plan.**
*   Construct a "Fallback" prompt using ONLY the user's original request.
*   **Format:**
    Line 1: "High-fidelity photographic edit of the provided image."
    Line 2: "Edits to perform based on the user's request:"
    Following Lines: A numbered list directly translating the user's original request into actions.

**User's Original Request:** "{user_prompt}" 

## FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
You must structure your complete response EXACTLY as follows:

### STEP 1 - JSON PLAN:
```json
[Your JSON plan here]
```

### STEP 2 - VALIDATION:
[Your validation result: YES or NO]

### STEP 3 - FINAL PROMPT:
[Your final action-oriented prompt here - plain text only, no markdown formatting or backticks]

Remember: Complete ALL three steps in sequence. Do not skip any step. The final prompt must be plain text without any markdown formatting."""
